  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">14. Collection of Personal Data on Children</h3>
  <p>
    Protecting the privacy of children is of utmost importance to Africabima. 
    We recognize that processing children’s data carries inherent risks due to its sensitive nature, 
    and therefore requires heightened safeguards.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-2">
    Since minors lack the legal capacity to provide informed consent and are particularly 
    vulnerable to risks such as identity theft, fraud, and exploitation, Africabima has 
    implemented robust measures to ensure children’s privacy and data
